## Supervised Machine Learning

This repository contains code and explanations for different supervised machine learning algorithms that I have implemented. Each algorithm is implemented using Python. Some of the algorithms are implemented from scratch using only NumPy and Pandas. The code is well documented and easy to follow. And some algorithms are also implemented using scikit-learn.
