## Principal Component Analysis
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used in machine learning and statistics. It helps in transforming high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation while retaining as much of the original variance as possible. We use PCA to identify the principal components (or directions) that capture the maximum variability in the data. It mainly includes the following steps:

1. Data Standardization: Standardize the data by subtracting the mean and scaling by the standard deviation to ensure all features have the same scale.

2. Compute the Covariance Matrix: Compute the covariance matrix for the standardized data, which represents the relationships between different features.

3. Calculate Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues: Eigenvectors represent the directions of maximum variance, and eigenvalues indicate the magnitude of the variance in those directions.

4. Choose the Number of Components: Decide on the number of principal components to retain. This choice is often based on how much variance you want to preserve in the data. A common approach is to set a threshold.

5. Projection: Form a projection matrix using the top-k eigenvectors, where k is the chosen number of components. This matrix is used to transform the original data into the new lower-dimensional space.
